## Commands

### `new`
Alias: `n`
* Make creating a new branch easier to type by joining all given args with a dash (`-`).
* Automatically push and setup tracking to `origin`.

#### Example
```
‚ùØ lk new readme updates
Switched to a new branch 'readme-updates'
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote:
To github.com:kyle-rader/loki-cli.git
 * [new branch]      readme-updates -> readme-updates
branch 'readme-updates' set up to track 'origin/readme-updates'.
```

### `push`
Alias: none
* Pushes the current branch to origin with `--set-upstream`.
* `-f|--force` flag uses `--force-with-lease` under the hood for better force push safety.
* Only works if `HEAD` is on a branch (not in a dettached state).
